This is a simple MIPS assembler and disassembler project implemented in Python.

Prerequisites:

- PyParsing:
  http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com
  
- Bitstring:
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitstring

How To Use:

- Create a text file containing your assembly/machine code

- Run assembler.py/disassembler.py

- An output text file will be created in the same directory containing
  the assembled/disassmbled code

  
Notes:

- Not all instructions are implemented, but more can be added easily

- Code structure and documentation can be improved drastically, but it 
  just works like it should for now
